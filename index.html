    <h1>Webpage for me</h1>
    <p>This is a fun webpage for <em>me</em> to be able to have</p>
    <p>I like having webpages for these reasons:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Having fun</li>
    <li>Enjoying my life</li>
    <li>Having a ball</li>
</ul>
<p>See my <a href=page2.html>other page</a> to learn more about why having a webpage is so fun for me.</p>
<p>If it's still not clicking, just <a href="https://google.com">google it.</a></p>
